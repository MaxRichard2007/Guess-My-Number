# Guess-My-Number

Hi everyone
My project name (guess my number).
In this game you have to guess what the secret number is?
And in this repository you can see two folders named version 1 and 2
In folder one (version 1) you can play and enjoy the game, but you have bad code, the (do not repeat) rule is not respected.
But in folder two (version 2) we have the game that you saw in version 1, but the code is much cleaner and the rule (do not repeat) is respected.

And thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann">Jonas Schmidtman</a>
for his wonderful work

Enjoy the game
