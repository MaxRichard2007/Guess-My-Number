# Guess-My-Number

Hi everyone👋<br>
My project name (guess my number🤔).<br>
In this game you have to guess what the secret number is?<br>
And in this repository you can see two folders named version 1 and 2<br>
In folder one (version 1) you can play and enjoy the game, but you have bad code, the (do not repeat) rule is not respected.<br>
But in folder two (version 2) we have the game that you saw in version 1, but the code is much cleaner and the rule (do not repeat) is respected.<br><br>

And thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann">Jonas Schmidtman</a>
for his wonderful work<br><br>

Enjoy the game🙏
