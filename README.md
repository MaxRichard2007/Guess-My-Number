# Guess My Number

Welcome to Guess My Number game! This project is a simple number guessing game where you have to guess the secret number.

## Introduction

In this game, you will try to guess the secret number chosen by the computer. You will be given hints about whether your guess is too high or too low. Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible!

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, simply download or clone this repository to your local machine. You will find two folders: `version1` and `version2`. Each folder contains a different version of the game.

## Versions

### Version 1

In the `Version 1` folder, you can play and enjoy the game, but the code may not be as optimized as it could be. Additionally, the "do not repeat" rule might not be respected in this version.
